TODO:

Replace the foxes images for dog pictures obtained from the local database:
- Allow the user to upload a pic of his/her dog, the name and location of its favourite park ( this field may be empty ), then store the info in the db
- Display at random one of the dogs with the available info
- Make the UI look pretty :)

Try not to use external libraries and to stick to ecmas6 js standards :)

Already installed libraries:
Bootstrap 4
